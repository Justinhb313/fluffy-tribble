## Our Partners
Our clients encompass a wide spectrum of the healthcare industry, from small community not-for-profit children’s hospitals to large 90 hospital institutions spanning multiple geographic time zones. By focusing on exceptional client service and strong relationships, we have established long term partnerships with our clients and are highly involved in helping to achieve their strategic goals. Many times, we partner with not only our direct clients, but also work collaboratively with our client’s software vendors to ensure highly successful project outcomes.
